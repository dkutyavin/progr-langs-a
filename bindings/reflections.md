## Notes

- There is dynamic environment - contains evaluated values
- There is static environment - contains types of variables; computed before evaluation

- Variable binding

  - Example:

    ```
    val x = e;
    ```

  - Syntax:

    - _Keyword_ `val` and _punctuation_ = and ;

    - _Variable **x**_
    - _Expression **e**_
      - Many forms of these, most containing _subexpressions_
